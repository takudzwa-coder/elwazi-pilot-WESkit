## Aim

<!-- Before submitting a feature request

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/documentation) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Search the [issues](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/issues) to see whether the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, feel free to add a comment to the existing issue, to highlight the specifics of your use case, or just to support the request.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.
