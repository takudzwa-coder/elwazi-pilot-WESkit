## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/documentation).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/issues) that might help you. 
In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. 
It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. 
Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. 
Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/documentation). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug.
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Use the bug template ("Description" drop-down list) to provide information. 

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> WARNING If this is a security-related bug, then you should not post bug report here as a GitLab issue. In this case, please report the bug at <weskit@dkfz-heidelberg.de>.
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/issues/new) using the bug template("Description" drop-down list).
- Please provide as much context as possible within each subsection of the template.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps and otherwise come back to you.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Suggesting Features

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for WESkit, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. 
Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Feature

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/documentation) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Feature Suggestion?

Feature suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://gitlab.com/one-touch-pipeline/weskit/api/issues).

- Using the feature template(default), please provide a **detailed description of the suggested feature**.
- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
