    # QUEUED: The task is queued.
    #
    # WESkit: A task is queued as soon as some Celery task is submitted for it and in
    #         Celery:PENDING state. This may be a run-task representing a workflow engine run
    #         (INITIALIZING -> QUEUE -> RUNNING), but may also include a preparatory task to stage
    #         large request-attachments, etc. (QUEUE -> INITIALIZING -> RUNNING).
    QUEUED = 1

    # > INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run.
    #                 For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.
    #
    # WESkit: The initialization of the actual workflow engine execution takes place. This may
    #         include final upload of large attachments, directory creation, etc. Also, if data
    #         need to be pre-staged in the run environment (e.g. downloaded from object storage
    #         this is part of the INITIALIZING state.
    INITIALIZING = 2

    # > RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor
    #            has been started.
    #
    # WESkit: An "Executor" seems to be executing individual workfload jobs ("first Executor", etc.)
    #         WESkit has no access to these Executors, which are managed by the workflow engines.
    #         Thus, the RUNNING state is assumed, as long as the workflow engine runs.
    RUNNING = 3

    # > PAUSED: The task is paused.
    #           An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.
    #
    # WESkit: Not supported yet.
    PAUSED = 4

    # > COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
    # and output files have been successfully uploaded.
    #
    # WESkit: All workload jobs and the workflow engine executed with exit code == 0.
    COMPLETE = 5

    # > EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
    #                   this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.
    #
    # WESKIT: The "task" corresponds to a worklow engine execution. The workflow executes workload
    # jobs that correspond to the "Executors". The workflows, however, contain also code that is
    # executed by the workflow engine directly (which is an implementation detail of the engine).
    # Therefore, any error during the workflow processing by the engine -- be it in the core
    # workflow or in any of its workload jobs -- should map to EXECUTOR_ENGINE. E.g.
    #
    # * validation error of the config.yaml
    # * parameter validation/processing error in the workflow code
    # * errors during the execution of the workload (e.g. on the cluster).
    #
    # This means, the EXECUTOR_ERROR usually is used, if the workflow engine exited with code > 0.
    EXECUTOR_ERROR = 6

    # > SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
    #                 for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out
    #                 of disk space, etc.
    #
    # WESkit: Any error of the WESkit system itself. Examples are
    #
    # * Celery worker error
    # * Errors in infrastructure (DB, Redis, Keycloak, etc.)
    # * Filesystem errors (inaccessible mounts, etc.), other than client-caused file access errors
    #   (e.g. wrong paths).
    # * WESkit.Executor errors (cluster errors, SSH errors, etc.)
    SYSTEM_ERROR = 7

    # > CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.
    #
    # WESkit: The workflow engine run (~ task) has been successfully cancelled.
    CANCELED = 8

    # > CANCELING: The task was canceled by the user, and is in the process of stopping.
    #
    # WESkit: The workflow engine run (~ task) is being cancelled, e.g. waiting for the engine
    #         to respond to SIGTERM and clean up running cluster jobs, compiling incomplete run
    #         run results, etc.
